## Overall Flow of petRPG and Brief Overview

* The goal: Keep your pet healthy by planning a day using block code. The better your schedule, the longer you survive.

  * When you start the game, you start off at level 1 with $50. Your pet has 5 variables: health, hygiene, hunger, energy, and happiness. Additionally, your character has 2 variables: currentFood, and level. Gameplay is infinite, however, as you level up, the game gets harder, as incrementing variables take more cash and is slower. The game ends when you get lose 2 "hearts." You lose a heart when your cash or any pet care variable goes to 0 or below 0 after executing your scheduele. However, after you lose your first heart, you gain a "loan" of $50 to recuperate your variables to get them higher. This game is all about logical planning and scheduling a day for the future. A running total of all your expenses is in the "status section".

* To increase these variables, a user has to use block logic to plan their day, which teaches the user how to logically think along with planning for the future.
